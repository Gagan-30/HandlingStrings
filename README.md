# HandlingStrings

String manipulation

str1 = “The spotted cuckoo ”
str2 = “ is flying backwards.”
str3 = “It’s a cold day for pontooning.”

1)	Concatenate str1 and str2 so that the sentence is correct. (Use trim.)

2)	Output the length of all three individual strings and the total length. 

3)	Write a program to extract and output the following as one sentence:
a.	Index 27-29 of str3
b.	Index 12-13 of str2
c.	Index 4-8 of str1

4)	Write a program to find the index of the character ‘o’ in str3.

5)	Write a program to find the index of the string “on” in str3.

6)	Write a program to find how many times the character ‘o’ appears in str3.

7)	Write a program to reverse a string inputted by the user (use subString).

8)	Write a program that allows player 1 to input a word. Player 2 should then have 5 tries to guess the word. If they get it correct it must display “You psychic.” else display “You lose.”

9)	Create an application that will take in ASCII codes and output the corresponding character. It must:
a.	Ask the user how many characters there are to decode
b.	Create an array to store the entered codes
c.	Output all the characters for the corresponding codes as a sentence (using iteration)
Use your program to decode the following message:
89, 111, 117, 32, 97, 114, 101, 32, 97, 32, 110, 101, 114, 100, 33
